Angular 2 Plugin for WordPress

This is my first attempt to create a plugin for WordPress with which you can launch Angular 2 applications in your Pages or Posts.
After installing and activating the plugin there is a Angular 2 Coder Setting page :
<img src="../master/images/angular2pluginsetting.png" alt="Plugin settings" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
Here you can decide some options like Enable on Pages or Posts.
In this first version of Angular2Coder Plugin, applications exists after apps directory (inside this plugin).
A live demo you can see in this page :
